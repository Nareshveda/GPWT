To control/switch-OFF motor on tank full status for a overhead water tank

The project is to control(Semi automatic) or avoid water wastage due to watertank overflow at overhead structures.
Greenpark apartments have a complex working practice to fillup the water tanks on daily basis.
In short, 5 different motors pumps-up the water to 9 different tanks in 3 different blocks.

Each block has three isolated tanks for Toilet, Bathroom and Drinking/kitchen usage.
each tank has separate inlet pipe and an outlet pipe as well.

This Project is programmed in such a way that the motor shall be switched-OFF when a particular tank is full and about to overflow.
Using an Arduino pro mini, MPU6050 (accelerometer sensor), relay with driver module and appropriate indicators.
